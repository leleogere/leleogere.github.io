# My personal resume.

You can find it [here](https://leleogere.github.io/resume/).

Please note that this is still a work in progress and that it is very likely to change regularly as long as I'm not fully satisfied.

Feel free to use it as a template for your own resume, but I would appreciate to be credited I you mind.
